JS Record Store

CodeClan week 10 Javascript homework

Learning Objectives

Implement an OO JS program using the 'new' keyword
Practice adding methods to objects
Using JS data structures and loops
Practice building a TDD program from scratch

Requirements

Create a constructor to create Record objects with artist, title, price
Create some new records
Create a RecordStore that has a name, city and multiple records in it's inventory
Give the RecordStore a balance i.e. cash in bank.
Add some records to your RecordStore.
Create a method that lists the inventory.
Create a method so that the RecordStore can sell a record. Adjust the cash in bank to take into account the price of the record sold
Create a method that reports on the financial situation of the store. Cash and value of inventory.
Create a RecordCollector (or customer) constructor who can buy and sell records.
If you choose to, you can use lodash for enumerable functionality.
Use TDD all the way through!


In addition to the above I experimented with different filtering methods and thought about the need to change the price of records when a store buys something new which it will then want to sell on. I also considered how the program may be used, such as you may want to filter the inventory and have a method which returns the actual objects so you can then go on and do something further with the objects - such as print them in a nice list for reference.
I have also investigated setting default values and the pros and cons of different ways of doing this.
